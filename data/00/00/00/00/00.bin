00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,310
{\an8}L.1130: 你恐怕不太明白现在的情况  你输了  我们找到你了
我: 拜托  当然了

8
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,390
{\an8}洛基·劳菲森

9
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,850
{\an8}洛基将于第二季回归

10
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,150
你并非生来注定为王  洛基
You weren't born to be king, Loki.

11
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,610
而是注定带来痛苦  苦难和死亡
You were born to cause pain and suffering and death.

12
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,990
只有时间守护者避免我们
The Time-Keepers are all that stand

13
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,820
遭遇绝对灾难
between us and full-scale calamity.

14
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,690
时时刻刻
For all time.

15
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,650
永永远远
Always.

16
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,650
为什么把我关在这
Why am I locked in here?

17
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,650
你背叛了时管局
You were disloyal to the TVA.

18
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,320
你去过时间守护者的房间  他们不是真的
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers. They weren't real.

19
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,530
-那又能改变什么  -那改变了一切
- And why does that change anything? - That changes everything!

20
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,190
你俩引起的关联事件
The nexus event the two of you caused,

21
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,360
不管是什么  都能摧毁这里
whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down.

22
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,490
这对我来说是新体验  之前在拉曼蒂斯上时
This is new for me. Back on Lamentis...

23
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,490
如果你相信我  我可以帮你
I can help you if you trust me.

24
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,450
我们要找的人就在时间尽头的虚空之外
The person we're after is beyond The Void at the end of time.

25
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,400
那怪物就是他们的看门狗  保护着唯一的入口
That thing is just their guard dog protecting the only way in.

26
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,860
-那我们怎么越过看门狗  -我要用魅术控制它
- How do we get past the guard dog? - I'm gonna enchant it.

27
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,110
她相当有自信
She's pretty confident.

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,530
快
Go!

29
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,320
厉害  小豆子
Way to go, Tic Tac!

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,450
这样出拳才对
That's how you punch.

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,110
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,190
不  你是该没听过我
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,570
-你先别挂  -斗舞  哥们
- Let me put you on hold. - Dance-off, bro.

34
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,780
-他是我战友  -我可以和你耗一整天
- A friend from work. - I can do this all day.

35
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,240
-我知道  -我让你见识下什么叫猛
- Yeah, I know. - I'll show you ferocity.

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,900
更高  更远  更快啊  亲爱的
Higher, further, faster, baby.

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,940
我们有绿巨人
We have a Hulk.

38
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,570
我们要跳上那艘飞船离开这里
We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here.

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,490
要一起来吗
Wanna come?

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,740
我们认为时间是单向的
We think of time as a one-way motion.

41
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,990
一个人的一小步
One small step for man...

42
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,450
他们怎么敢
How dare they!

43
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,530
我的梦
My dream...

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,490
我们为拥有和平而战
We have fought for the right to experience peace.

45
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,150
光荣使命
Glorious purpose!

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,030
受全世界女性的激励
Motivated by women throughout the world.

47
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,900
何为悲痛  不就是萦绕不去的爱吗
What is grief, if not love persevering?

48
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,360
我会崛起
I will rise.

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,530
睁开眼睛
Open your eyes.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,990
你不打算叫我别踢门吗
Aren't you gonna tell me not to kick the door in?

51
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,950
说不说有什么关系呢
It never made a difference.

52
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,530
如果你觉得这样不好
Well, if you think it's a bad idea,

53
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,490
我更希望你说出来
I prefer you to speak your mind.

54
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,400
不  没什么想说的
No. Nothing to say.

55
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,400
那倒是头一遭
That'll be a first.

56
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,900
你还好吗
Everything okay?

57
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,320
嗯  就想缓缓
Yeah. Just need a moment.

58
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,070
嗯
Right.

59
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,610
-就是你一般...  -洛基  闭嘴
- It's just, you normally... - Loki, shut up.

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,240
你诞生之前  我就被删除了
I was pruned before you even existed.

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,570
我这辈子都在等待这一刻
I have been waiting for this moment my entire life.

62
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,070
我就需要点时间整理思绪  好吗
I just need a second to get my head straight, okay?

63
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,240
好  当然
Sure. Of course.

64
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,030
你们好
Hey, y'all.

65
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,950
又是你
You again?

66
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,950
欢迎来到时间尽头的大教堂
Welcome to The Citadel at the End of Time.

67
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,150
来吧
Come on.

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,240
恭喜
Congratulations.

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,610
你们为了来到这里经历了漫长的旅程
Y'all had an awfully long journey to get here.

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,570
他很钦佩
He's impressed.

71
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,280
你说谁
Who's impressed?

72
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,530
存留者
He Who Remains.

73
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,400
他是谁
And who is he?

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,610
他创造了一切  控制了一切
He created all and he controls all.

75
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,240
在尽头  就只有存留者
At the end, it is only He Who Remains.

76
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,280
他想跟你们做个交易
And he wants to offer you a deal.

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,740
他进行了一些创意调整
He's been making a few creative adjustments,

78
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,820
他已经盘算好
and he's worked it out

79
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,440
要怎么把你们放回时间线里
so we can reinsert both of y'all back into the Timeline

80
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,400
而不造成干扰
in a way that won't disrupt things.

81
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,900
"不造成干扰"
"Won't disrupt things"?

82
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,610
时管局可以继续进行他们重要的工作
The TVA can keep doin' its vital work

83
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,450
你们也可以过上你们一直想要的生活
and y'all can live the lives you've always wanted.

84
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,400
我们一直想要什么呢
And what have we always wanted?

85
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,280
别跟我装了  先生
Now, don't play coy with me, mister.

86
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,490
你清楚你怎么卷进这摊麻烦里的
You know how you got into this mess.

87
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,610
什么
What?

88
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,030
纽约之战  傻瓜
The Battle of New York, silly.

89
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,570
你对抗那些自以为是的复仇者
You versus those self-righteous Avengers.

90
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,780
你想赢吗
How would you like to win?

91
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,070
但不仅如此
But not just there.

92
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,240
你还可以杀了灭霸
You can kill Thanos.

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,110
你想要无限手套吗  那是你的了
You want the Infinity Gauntlet? Yours.

94
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,280
阿斯加德的王位  没问题
Throne of Asgard? No problem.

95
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,320
你呢  姑娘
What about you, missy?

96
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,030
那么多年来四处逃窜
All those years on the run.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,570
绝望  孤独
Desperate, alone.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,740
你想不想明早醒来
How would you like to wake up tomorrow

99
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,400
只有一辈子幸福的记忆
with just a lifetime of happy memories?

100
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,900
两个洛基在一个地方
Two Lokis in the same place.

101
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,820
我们俩
Both of us...

102
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,360
一起在一条时间线上
together on the Timeline.

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,650
很疯狂  但他能做到
It's crazy, but he could make it work.

104
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
这一切
All of it.

105
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,030
所有一切
Everything.

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
都完全如你们一直以来所愿
Exactly the way you've always wanted.

107
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,610
你们可以一起拥有
And you can have it all, together.

108
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,490
这是谎言
It's fiction.

109
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,070
我们现在要自己书写命运了
We write our own destiny now.

110
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,240
当然了  祝你们好运
Oh, sure you do. Good luck with that.

111
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,240
来吧
Come on.

112
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,860
你好啊
Hey, there.

113
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,900
-你怎么才来  -抱歉
- What took you so long? - Sorry.

114
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,650
有事要解决
Some things had to get worked out,

115
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,360
但我正在下载你需要的文件
but I'm downloadin' the files you need now.

116
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,440
我要的不是这个
This isn't what I asked for.

117
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,610
我知道  但他觉得这个更有用
I know, but he thinks this'll be more useful.

118
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,740
谁
Who?

119
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,450
好好看吧
Happy readin'.

120
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,700
存留者
He Who Remains.

121
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,110
存在不了多久了
Not for much longer.

122
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,400
我们能确定他还活着吗
Are we sure he's even still alive?

123
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,030
真疯狂啊
This is wild.

124
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,320
你们俩  是同一个人
The two of you... ...same person.

125
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,400
有点有违自然  但是
I mean, it's a little unnatural. But...

126
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,650
疯狂
Wild.

127
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,780
存留者
He Who Remains.

128
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,150
存留者
He Who Remains.

129
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,820
她还那么喊我吗
She still calls me that?

130
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,240
吓人  是吧  但是
Creepy, right? But...

131
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,450
我喜欢
I like it.

132
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,360
来吧  来我办公室聊
Come on. Come on, let's talk in my office.

133
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,150
跟你们想的不一样吗
Not what you were expecting, hmm?

134
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,490
你只是个...人
You're just... A man.

135
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,860
血肉之躯
Flesh and blood.

136
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,280
-别说我令人失望  -不
- Don't tell me I'm a disappointment. - No.

137
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,700
就是更好杀了
Just a little bit easier to kill.

138
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,530
进来吧
Come on in.

139
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,780

One...

140
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,030

请坐吧
Please, take a seat.

142
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,610
洛基
Uh, Loki.

143
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,110
洛基
Loki.

144
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,700
两块糖
Two sugars.

145
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,240
我说了不要打扰我
I said I wasn't to be disturbed.

146
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,530
那你见到我肯定不会高兴了
Well, then you're not gonna be happy to see me.

147
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,030
他回来了
He's back.

148
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,240
如果有人能从虚空回来
If anyone was ever gonna make it back from The Void,

149
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,740
应该就是你了
I suppose it was gonna be you.

150
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,440
你懂的
Oh, well, you know,

151
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,400
一个人的虚空  对另一个人是小菜一碟
one man's Void is another man's piece of cake.

152
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,400
-你要删除我吗  -这主意好
- So, you're gonna prune me? - I like that idea.

153
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,580
但我在这方面的标准
But, you know, my standards might be

154
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,690
可能比你的要稍高点
a little bit higher in that area than yours.

155
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,330
对于亲密朋友什么的
You know, with close personal friends.

156
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,780
对不起  莫比乌斯
I'm sorry, Mobius.

157
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,150
我不能允许你阻碍我们的任务
I couldn't let you get in the way of our mission.

158
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,070
任务
Mission?

159
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,670
时间守护者是假的  我们都是时间异体
The Time-Keepers are fake. We're all Variants.

160
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,610
什么任务
What mission?

161
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,240
不能都是毫无意义的  所以我必须删除你
It can't have been for nothing. That's why I had to prune you.

162
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,570
追踪者D90  马上来我办公室
Hunter D-90 to my office, immediately.

163
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,780
嗯  抱歉  萝雯娜
Yeah. Sorry, Ravonna.

164
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,900
那不会有用的
That's not gonna work out the way you think it is,

165
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,570
我们知道你的秘密了
now that we know your secret.

166
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,650
你做了什么
What did you do?

167
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,610
警惕点  她就在附近
Stay alert, she's close.

168
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,450
封锁周边  我去抓她
Secure the perimeter. I've got her.

169
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,150
束手就擒吧  B15
Stand down, B-15.

170
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,740
你需要听我说
You need to listen to me.

171
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,860
-回头有时间让你说  -等等
- There'll be time for that. - Just wait.

172
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,820
这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

173
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,400
伦斯雷尔法官
Judge Renslayer.

174
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,610
什么
What?

175
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,610
你是谁  你们来我学校干什么
Who are you? And what the hell are you doing in my school?

176
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,780
那不是伦斯雷尔法官
That isn't Judge Renslayer.

177
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,950
怎么回事
How?

178
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,490
我们有很多要谈的
We have a lot to talk about.

179
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,990
你的这段旅程很长  是吧
Been a long journey for you, hasn't it?

180
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,450
东躲西藏  历尽磨难
Lot of running, lot of pain.

181
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,570
你呢
And you...

182
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,860
你就是骑龙的跳蚤
You're a flea on the back of a dragon.

183
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,950
经历了一场大冒险
In for one hell of a ride.

184
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,740
但你还是一直抓住了
But you did manage to hang on.

185
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,320
这也算厉害吧
I guess that counts for something.

186
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,450
你恐怕不太明白现在的情况
I'm not sure you quite understand the situation.

187
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,900
你输了
You've lost.

188
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,450
我们找到你了
We found you.

189
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,950
拜托  当然了
Duh. Of course you did.

190
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,030
挥剑没中
A swing and a miss.

191
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,650
我们还要这么玩啊
So, we're still doing that, hmm?

192
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,780
我们先把这说明白吧
Let's get all this out of the way.

193
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,280
好
Okay.

194
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,570
找到了
Here we go.

195
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,900
你们无法杀我  因为
You can't kill me because

196
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,200
我已经知道会发生什么了
I already know what's going to happen.

197
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,240
看到了吗
See?

198
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
这是雕虫小技
It's a parlor trick.

199
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,150
好吧
Okay.

200
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,190
你就不好奇
Don't you wonder

201
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,240
我怎么能在你刚要杀我前  闪开吗
how I'm able to get out of the way just before you kill me?

202
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,820
不  那是因为你有时空器
No. It's because of that little TemPad you have there.

203
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,740
嗯
Right.

204
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,870
但我怎么能已经在里面下载了
But how do I already have it loaded up

205
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,690
我需要知道的一切
with everything I need to know

206
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,030
从而避免被你俩杀掉呢
to keep from being killed by you two?

207
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,030
很简单
It's easy.

208
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,200
我什么都知道
I know it all.

209
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,490
什么都看过了
And I've seen it all.

210
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,950
你们在拉曼蒂斯上做的一切  我都看到了
Everything you guys did on Lamentis, I saw.

211
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,700
时管局不知道的那些事  我都知道
All the stuff the TVA didn't know about, I knew.

212
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,240
各种计谋  各种...
All the scheming, all the...

213
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,780
对话
...talking.

214
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,530
湖边的眼神
That little look by the lake.

215
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,110
对了  很动情  让人感动
Quite sentimental, very touching stuff, by the way.

216
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,320
不
No.

217
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,490
不  我们突破了你的小游戏
No, we broke out of your little game.

218
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,070
所以才来到了这里
That's how we got here.

219
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,030
不  错了
No, wrong.

220
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,900
你们走到这里的每一步
Every step you took to get here,

221
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,400
拉曼蒂斯  虚空
Lamentis, The Void,

222
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,700
都是我铺了路
I paved the road.

223
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,610
你们
You...

224
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,320
只是沿着路走
You just walked down it.

225
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,570
剩下的也都在这里
And I have the rest, uh, right here.

226
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,650
一切...
Everything that's, uh...

227
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,990
即将发生的事  只有一种结局
that's going to happen. There's only one way this can go.

228
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,400
-那为什么让我们来  -拜托
- Then why are we here? - Oh, come on.

229
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,320
你知道你要被旅途改变
You know you can't get to the end

230
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,610
才能走到终点
until you've been changed by the journey.

231
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,490
这件事  必须发生
This stuff, it needs to happen.

232
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,030
让我们进入最佳心态  好完成征途
To get us all in the right mindset to finish the quest.

233
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,280
-好吧  -嗯
- Right. - Right.

234
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,450
所以都是游戏
So, it's all a game.

235
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,280
都是...操纵
It's all... A manipulation.

236
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,650
有意思  你会这么想
Interesting, that your head would go to that.

237
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,990
茜薇
Sylvie,

238
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,150
你觉得你能信任他吗
you think you can trust this guy?

239
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,860
-别听他的  -"别听他的"
- Don't listen to him. - "Don't listen to him."

240
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,570
你觉得你能信任任何人吗
Do you think you're even capable of trusting anyone at all?

241
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,990
我觉得大家准备好听到真相了
I think people are ready to hear a little truth now.

242
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,690
比如时管局是个谎言
You know, like the TVA is a lie.

243
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,320
但如果是必要的谎言呢
But what if it's a necessary one?

244
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,650
有人创造了时间守护者
Someone created the Time-Keepers.

245
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,650
还创造了这里  给了我们使命
They created this whole place. They gave us all purpose.

246
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,990
我必须相信  那是有理由的
I have to believe they had a reason.

247
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,820
不  因为我见识过
No, because I've seen the horror

248
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,400
等待着被删除的人的恐怖
waiting for people when they get pruned

249
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,280
那绝没有必要性可言
and there's nothing necessary about that.

250
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,070
你知道我们如果不去删减时间分支会怎样吗
You know what would happen if we didn't prune the Timeline?

251
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,400
-怎样  -混乱  死亡
- What? - Chaos. Death.

252
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
自由意志吗
Free will?

253
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,150
自由意志
Free will?

254
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,360
只有一个人有自由意志  管事的那个
Only one person gets free will. The one in charge.

255
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,490
"永恒的朋友  永远的盟友"
"Friends across time, allies to the end."

256
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,490
-闭嘴  -多美的说辞
- Shut up. - That was so beautiful.

257
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,400
然后你送我去死  你是怎么了
And then you sent me to die. What happened to you?

258
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
没怎么  莫比乌斯  我没变
Nothing, Mobius. I didn't change.

259
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,990
你没变  你背叛了我
You didn't change? You betrayed me.

260
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,990
不  是你背叛了我
No, no. You betrayed me!

261
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,240
我很照顾你  替你担了风险
I looked out for you, hung my neck out for you,

262
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,360
你遭遇了信仰危机  就投向了那些时间异体吗
and you suffer a crisis of faith and turn to those Variants?

263
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,860
那么久的友谊
Eons of friendship.

264
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,360
你为了两个洛基就抛弃了一切
And you threw it all away on a couple of Lokis.

265
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,280
不  莫比乌斯  我没背叛你
No, Mobius. I didn't betray you.

266
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,950
我们不能夺走人们的自由意志  萝雯娜
We can't take away people's free will, Ravonna.

267
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,320
你不懂吗
Do you not see that?

268
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,110
-你干什么  -做我必须做的
- What are you doing? - What I need to do.

269
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,700
等等  别走
Wait, stop.

270
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,610
或许我们可以一起把它变得更好
Look, maybe we can build this into something better together.

271
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,780
对不起  莫比乌斯
I'm sorry, Mobius.

272
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,400
我不会让你走的
I'm not gonna let you go.

273
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,740
拜托  莫比乌斯
Please, Mobius.

274
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,950
即便有那个
Even with that...

275
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,400
你对我也不构成威胁
you're of no danger to me.

276
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,650
是吗
Is that what you think?

277
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,490
走着瞧吧
Let's see.

278
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,740
嗯  你说对了
Yep, you were right.

279
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,990
又是这样了
Back here again.

280
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,490
来吧
Go ahead.

281
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,990
你要去哪
Where are you gonna go?

282
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,610
寻找自由意志
In search of free will.

283
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,530
我理解你们对时管局工作的道德反感
I understand your moral objections to what the TVA does.

284
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,900
我的手段是充满欺骗
And my methods are deceptive.

285
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,450
但使命可不是欺骗
But the mission, it never was.

286
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,700
没有我  没有时管局
Without the me, without the TVA...

287
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,610
一切都会毁灭
everything burns.

288
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,200
那你还怕什么
Then what are you so afraid of?

289
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,010
我
Me.

290
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,600
你究竟是谁
And just who are you?

291
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,850
很多人给过我很多名字
Oh, I've been dubbed many names by many people.

292
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,110
统治者  征服者
A ruler, a conqueror.

293
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,810
存留者  混蛋
He Who Remains, a jerk.

294
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,470
但这并不单单是个名字的事
But it's... it's not as simple as a name.

295
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,710
很久以前  时管局建立前
Eons ago, before the TVA,

296
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,930
我的一个时间异体生活在31世纪的地球上
a variant of myself lived on Earth in the 31st century.

297
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,980
他是个科学家  他发现
He was a scientist and he discovered

298
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,980
宇宙是层层叠叠的
that there were universes stacked on top of his own.

299
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,150
同时
At the same time,

300
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,190
我们的其他版本也发现了这个奥秘
other versions of us were learning the same thing.

301
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,880
不用说  我们相互联系了
Naturally, they made contact.

302
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,170
在一段时间里  大家和平共处
And for a while, there was peace.

303
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,630
自恋  自我恭维的和平
Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace.

304
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,170
"我喜欢你的鞋"  "我喜欢你的发型"
"I love your shoes." "I love your hair."

305
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,280
"鼻子挺好看"  "谢谢  伙计"
"Oh, man, nice nose." "Thanks, man."

306
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,430
等等
Et cetera.

307
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,110
他们分享科技和知识
They shared technology and knowledge.

308
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,550
用自己宇宙里最好的东西来改善其他宇宙
Using the best of their universes to improve the others.

309
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,600
但是
However...

310
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,700
不是我的所有版本
not every version of me

311
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,090
都那么  心地纯良
was so... so pure of heart.

312
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,550
对有些人  新世界就只意味着一件事
To some of us, new worlds meant only one thing,

313
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,990
有可征服的新领地
new lands to be conquered.

314
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,320
现实间的和平
The peace between realities...

315
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,090
爆发成了一场大战
...erupted into all-out war,

316
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,490
每个时间异体都在拼力保护自己的宇宙
each variant fighting to preserve their universe

317
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,610
同时毁灭其他宇宙
and annihilate the others.

318
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,960
这几乎终结了
This was almost the end...

319
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,430
一切和所有人  女士们先生们
...ladies and gentlemen, of everything and everyone.

320
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,090
然后时间守护者出现了  救了我们所有人
And then the Time-Keepers came along and saved us all.

321
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:26,600
阿门
Amen

322
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,840
不对
No. No.

323
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,230
不  这就是我们偏离常规的地方了
Nope, this is where we diverge from the dogma.

324
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,690
那第一个时间异体遇到了一个东西
That first variant encountered a creature

325
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,850
它是因现实的撕裂诞生
created from all the tears in reality,

326
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,700
它能吞噬时间和空间
capable of consuming time and space itself.

327
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,970
这东西
A creature...

328
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,090
你们都认识
you both know.

329
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,010
埃里奥斯
Alioth.

330
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,960
对了
Bingo!

331
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,630
我控制住了那野兽的力量  开始做实验
I harnessed the beast's power and began experimenting on it.

332
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,480
我把埃里奥斯武器化了
I weaponized Alioth

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,710
我终结了多元宇宙战争
and I ended... I ended the Multiversal War.

334
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,330
我把我们的时间线隔离出来后
Once I isolated our timeline,

335
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,120
就只需要打理好时间流
all I had to do was manage the flow of time

336
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,040
并防止出现新分支
and prevent any further branches.

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,700
因此  我创立了时管局
Hence, the TVA.

338
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,490
因此  我创造了时间守护者和高效的官僚机构
Hence, the Time-Keepers and a highly efficient bureaucracy.

339
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,580
因此  我打造了
Hence, ages...

340
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,990
长久的和谐
...and ages of cosmic harmony.

341
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,210
因此
Hence...

342
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,550
你们不客气
you're welcome.

343
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,080
你们是来杀魔鬼的  对吗
You came to kill the devil, right?

344
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,710
你们猜怎么
Well, guess what?

345
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,320
我保护了你们
I keep you safe.

346
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,050
如果你们觉得我是邪恶的
And if you think I'm evil, well,

347
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,500
等你们见到我的其他时间异体再说吧
just wait till you meet my variants.

348
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,710
局面就是如此
And that's the gambit.

349
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,270
是压抑的秩序  还是灾难性的混乱
Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos.

350
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,950
你们可能恨独裁者  但
You may hate the dictator, but something...

351
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,910
如果把他推翻  会有更糟的东西来填补空白
...far worse is gonna fill that void if you depose of him.

352
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,620
我活了千万辈子了
I've lived a million lifetimes.

353
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,250
我经历了一切情况
I've gone through every scenario.

354
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,920
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

355
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,070
时管局
The TVA,

356
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,660
很有效
it works.

357
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,380
或者你在撒谎
Or you're a liar.

358
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,500
或者我在撒谎
Or I'm a liar.

359
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
所以你要
So you just...

360
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,170
继续删除无辜的时间线吗
continue to prune innocent timelines?

361
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,890
是你们去
You two would.

362
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,120
有两个选择  一
There's two options! One...

363
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,070
你们杀了我  毁了这一切
you kill me and destroy all this,

364
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,630
到时就不仅是一个魔鬼了
so you don't just have one devil,

365
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,340
而是有无限个
you have an infinite amount.

366
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,520
或者
Or...

367
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,460
你们俩
you two.

368
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,570
你们俩来管事
You two run the thing.

369
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,620
你撒谎
You're lying.

370
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,000
你为什么要放弃控制权
Why would you give up being in control?

371
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,630
伙计
Buddy...

372
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,340
我累了
I'm tired.

373
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,450
我年纪大了
And I'm older.

374
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,890
比看上去年纪大
I'm older than I look.

375
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,540
这游戏属于年轻人  有欲求的人
This game is for the young, the hungry.

376
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,630
我经历了很多次
I've gone through a lot of scenarios...

377
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,200
想找合适的人选来接替我
trying to find the right person to take this spot.

378
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,950
原来合适的人选  是两个
It turns out that person came in two.

379
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,260
但绝对是你们俩
But it's definitely you two.

380
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,340
所以  不再撒谎了
So, no more lies.

381
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,750
你们杀了我  神圣时间线就会完全暴露
You kill me and the Sacred Timeline is completely exposed.

382
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,330
多元宇宙战争
Multiversal War.

383
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,460
或者  你们接手  回时管局去
Or you take over and return to the TVA

384
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,330
做个仁慈的统治者
as its benevolent rulers.

385
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,520
告诉员工他们是谁  以及为什么要做这个
Tell the workforce who they are and why they do what they do.

386
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,670
你把活生生的人的生活  当作游戏
You treated real people's lives like some kind of game.

387
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,080
不是针对谁  只是务实
It's not personal, it's practical.

388
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,660
我就觉得被针对了
It was personal to me.

389
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,500
长大吧  茜薇
Grow up! Grow up, Sylvie!

390
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,540
杀人犯  伪君子
Murderer! Hypocrite!

391
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,670
我们都是坏人
We're all villains here.

392
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,780
我们都干过可怕  糟糕  不堪的事
We've all done horrible, terrible, horrific things.

393
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,120
但现在  我们  你们
But now, we, you...

394
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,540
有机会为了好理由做那种事
have a chance to do them for a good reason.

395
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,710
我们刚刚
We just crossed...

396
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,200
过分界点了
the threshold.

397
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,680
我说谎了
So, I fibbed.

398
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,740
我之前说我知道
I fibbed earlier when I said

399
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,300
一切的走向是在撒谎  我...
I know how everything's going to go. I...

400
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,020
我知道  我之前只知道截止到某个时间点前的事
I know... I knew... ...everything up to a certain point,

401
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,280
那个时间点大概就是
and that point was about...

402
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,880
七八九十秒之前
seven, eight, nine, ten seconds ago.

403
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,090
但我现在不知道了
But now I have no idea.

404
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,720
不知道接下来的事会如何发展
No idea how the rest of this is going to go.

405
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,200
我说的是真的
I'm being candid.

406
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,320
那就这样了吗
So, that's it?

407
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,310
就这样了吗
That's it?

408
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,660
时间尽头就是这样吗
This is what happens at the end of time?

409
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,710
你就打算坐在那里享受自由
And now you're just gonna sit there with all that freedom and...

410
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,470
让我们决定你的命运吗
let us decide your fate?

411
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,780
对
Yes!

412
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,870
对  最坏能怎样呢
Yes! Yes! What's the worst that can happen?

413
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,540
你们要么就...
You either...

414
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,960
接手  我的毕生事业得以继续
take over and my life's work continues

415
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,540
要么你们就给我胸口来一刀
or you plunge a blade in my chest

416
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,950
无限多的我
and an infinite amount of me...

417
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,550
开启另一场多元宇宙战争
start another Multiversal War.

418
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,580
我最终又会回到这里
And I just... end up right back here anyways.

419
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,270
这就是轮回转世
Reincarnation, baby.

420
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,940
不  那只是另一个谎言
No, it's just another lie.

421
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,180
另一个操控伎俩
Another manipulation.

422
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,590
不是谎言
No lie.

423
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,780
不是操控伎俩
No manipulation.

424
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,060
我好喜欢这个
I love this.

425
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,480
我喜欢这种诚实
I love... all this honesty.

426
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,910
感觉是一个全新的开始
Feels like a fresh start.

427
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,680
该死...
Oh, holy...

428
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,910
-你干什么  -茜薇  等等
- What're you doing? - Sylvie, hang on a moment.

429
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,820
我们好好谈谈
Let's just talk about it.

430
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,780
我们不如先完成我们要做的事  杀了他
Well, how about we finish what we started and kill him?

431
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,470
-如果他说的是实话呢  -那又怎样
- What if he's telling the truth? - So what?

432
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,870
-我相信他  -你相信什么
- I believe him. - You believe what?

433
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,540
有无数的妖怪会出现在这里
That a bazillion boogeymen is gonna turn up

434
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,390
就因为我们给了人们自由意志
just because we give people free will?

435
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,320
-他是个骗子  洛基  -我也是
- He's a liar, Loki. - So am I.

436
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,030
我觉得他没撒谎  在这件事上没有
And I don't think he was lying. Not about that.

437
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,830
疯狂吗  没错  但他可能说的是实话
Insane? Yes. But maybe he was telling the truth.

438
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,950
快点吧  时间线已经开始分支了
Better hurry. Timeline's already branching.

439
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,260
-你想说什么  -我们好好想想
- So, what are you suggesting? - That we think about it.

440
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,790
有什么可好好想想的
And what precisely is there to think about?

441
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,490
你没听他说的吗
Weren't you listening to what he was saying?

442
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,400
局面如此
That's the gambit.

443
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,760
除掉独裁者  填满虚空的是什么
Remove the dictator and what fills the void?

444
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,710
你想要王座
You want the throne?

445
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,230
不是的  不
No, that's not it. No.

446
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,400
-我不相信你  -茜薇  宇宙平衡了
- I don't believe you. - Sylvie, the universe is in the balance,

447
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,310
我们所熟知的一切  一切
everything we know to be true. Everything.

448
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
我知道时管局伤害了我俩
I know the TVA has hurt us both.

449
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,210
但如果干掉他以后
But what if by taking him out,

450
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,080
可能会释放出更难对付的东西呢
we risk unleashing something even worse?

451
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,240
我只想说  我们再稍微想一想
All I'm suggesting is we just take a minute to think about it.

452
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,080
我真心向你保证  我不是为了王座
I promise you from my heart this isn't about a throne.

453
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,420
我怎么能信任你
What was I thinking trusting you?

454
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,610
一切都是骗局吗
Has this whole thing been a con?

455
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,570
真的吗
Really?

456
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,490
你就这样看我吗
That's what you think of me...

457
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,540
发生了这么多之后
after all this time?

458
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,570
好啊  为什么不呢
Sure. Why not?

459
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,160
邪恶洛基的宏伟计划要实现了
Evil Loki's master plan comes together.

460
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,330
你根本从不信任我  对吗  那意义何在
Well, you never trusted me, did you? What was the point?

461
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,780
你不明白吗  这比我们的经历都更重要
Can't you see? This is bigger than our experience.

462
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,190
我们对此的看法为什么不同
Why aren't we seeing this the same way?

463
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,960
因为你无法相信别人
Because you can't trust...

464
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,950
我也不可信赖
and I can't be trusted.

465
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,170
看来我们有麻烦了
Then I guess we're in a pickle.

466
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,830
茜薇  等等
Sylvie, wait.

467
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,800
等一下
Wait.

468
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,580
茜薇  茜薇
Sylvie. Sylvie.

469
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,620
也许他在说谎  也许他没有
Maybe he's lying! Maybe he's not.

470
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,710
弄错的代价太大了
The cost of getting this wrong is too great.

471
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,780
好吧  动手吧
Fine. Do it.

472
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,580
杀了我  夺取你的王位
Kill me. Take your throne.

473
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,770
不
No.

474
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,010
茜薇  住手  住手
Sylvie, stop. Stop.

475
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,340
住手
Stop.

476
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,800
住手
Stop.

477
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,090
我经历过你现在的处境
I've been where you are.

478
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,320
我也感受过你现在的心情
I've felt what you feel.

479
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,230
别问我是怎么知道的
Don't ask me how I know.

480
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,160
我只知道
All I know...

481
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,690
我不想伤害你
is I don't wanna hurt you.

482
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,140
我不想要王位
I don't want a throne.

483
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,310
我...
I just...

484
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,980
我只希望你平安无事
I just want you to be okay.

485
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,080
但我不是你
But I'm not you.

486
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,440
难以置信
Incredible.

487
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,570
你不打算求饶吗
Aren't you gonna beg for your life?

488
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,470
我是可以求饶
Um, could, could.

489
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,580
我们很快会再见
I'll see you soon.

490
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,510
现在无法回头了
No turning back now.

491
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,410
谁说要回头了
Who said anything about turning back?

492
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,270
"时时刻刻"
"For all time."

493
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,750
"永永远远"
"Always."

494
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,690
收到  正赶往军械库  长官
Copy. Reporting to the armory, sir.

495
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,330
光是这个单位就有63条时间分支吗
That's, what, 63 new branches in this unit alone?

496
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,460
他是要我们任由它们全产生分支吗
Does he want us to just let them all branch?

497
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,060
我们现在要如何阻止它
At this point, how are we gonna stop it?

498
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,270
我们无法阻止
We can't!

499
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,350
什么
What?

500
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,140
你说什么
What'd you say?

501
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,590
已经结束了  莫比乌斯
It's done, Mobius.

502
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,420
我们犯了严重错误
We made a terrible mistake.

503
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,620
-什么结束了  -什么
- What's done? - What?

504
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,290
我们解放了时间线
We freed the Timeline.

505
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,640
我们在风暴的另一边找到了他
We found him beyond the storm.

506
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,920
一座在时间尽头的城堡
A Citadel at the End of Time.

507
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,110
他非常可怕  他策划了一切
He's terrifying. He planned everything.

508
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,160
他见识过一切  无所不知
He's seen everything. He knows everything.

509
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,300
事情很复杂  好吗
It's complicated. Okay?

510
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,080
-好  -但有人要来了
- Right. - But someone is coming.

511
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,410
一个极度危险人物的
Countless different versions

512
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,050
无数个不同版本
of a very dangerous person.

513
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,080
他们都是来开战的  我们需要准备迎战
And they're all set on war. We need to prepare.

514
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,230
冷静点  你是分析师  对吗
Take it easy. You're an analyst, right?

515
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,650
-你是哪个部门的  -什么
- What division are you from? - What?

516
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,610
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

517
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,350
你是谁  你叫什么
Who are you? What's your name?

518
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,450
马上派出地面部队  档案室
Boots on the ground now. Archives.

00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,350
你是谁
Who are you?
